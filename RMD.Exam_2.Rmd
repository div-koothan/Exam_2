```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

3. The dataset is a cross-section data set, because it shows a snapshot in time for the year 2015. 






```{r, include=FALSE}
library(rio)
ps2020 <- import ("fatal-police-shootings-data.csv")
ps2020overview <- ps2020
ps2020gender <- ps2020overview

```

Exam Practice Numbers 
```{r}
2+2
#this is math 
```

let us see how this prints 
```{r}
for(r in 1:nrow(ps2020gender)){
  if (ps2020gender$gender[r] == "M"){
    ps2020gender$gender[r] = "Male"
  } else if (ps2020gender$gender[r]=="F"){
    ps2020gender$gender[r] = "Female"
  } else if (ps2020gender$gender[r] == ''){
    ps2020gender$gender[r] = "Other/Unknown"
  }
}

str(ps2020)
```

printing to see how a for loop goes
```{r, echo = FALSE, comment=""}
mat <-matrix(data =seq(1, 10, by=1),
             nrow = 5, ncol =2)
print(mat)

for(r in 1:nrow(mat)) # for r in 1:5
  for(c in 1:ncol(mat))# for c in 1:2
    print(paste("Row", r, "and column",c, "have values of", mat[r,c]))

```

```{r, comment=""}
2+2
#hey
# comment!
```


Seeing How the Numbers Go
```{r}
#mean()
#let us see
```
Just one comment
```{r}
#does this come up
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
