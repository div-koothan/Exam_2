```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
1. #clear global environment 
rm(list = ls(all = TRUE))
```


```{r}
2. #loading rio library to import ineqaulity excel sheet
library(rio)
inequality_data <- import("inequality.xlsx")
```


3. The dataset is a cross-section data set, because it shows a snapshot in time for the year 2015. 
```{r}
#viewing data set to determine cross sectional or not 
summary(inequality_data)
```


```{r}
4. #subset Gini index for Sweden and Denmark
subset(inequality_data, select = c("country", "inequality_gini"), country == "Sweden"|country == "Denmark")
```


```{r}
5. #subset gini index for Brazil
subset(inequality_data, select = c("country", "inequality_gini"), country == "Brazil")
```


6. It is better to have a low inequality_gini score.


```{r}
7. #peak at dataframe
head(inequality_data)
```


```{r}
8.#create function
remove.accents <- function(s){
  #1 character substitutions
  old1 <- "Ãº"
  new1 <- "u"
  s1  <-chartr(old1,new1, s)
  
}

#apply function
inequality_data$country <- remove.accents(inequality_data$country)
#checking if function worked
head(inequality_data)
```


```{r}
9. #sorting inequality_gini by lowest score
inequality_data <- inequality_data[order(inequality_data$inequality_gini),]
#the top 5
head(inequality_data, 5)
```


10. The mean inequality_gini is 36.81375
```{r}
#finding the average inequality_gini
mean(inequality_data$inequality_gini, na.rm = TRUE)
```







```{r, comment=""}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
